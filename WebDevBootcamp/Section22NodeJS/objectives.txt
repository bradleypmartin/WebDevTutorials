# intro to Node

* What is Node?
A: node.js is a language in which we can write JS for server-side action

* Why are we learning it?
A: -high-performance
   -also uses JS (as we've done on the front end)
   -hip! (not a huge reason ;) )
   
* Remember that we're not here to learn specific technologies (they change very
  fast!), but rather to learn web development. Long term, we'll probably end up
  learning a bunch of technologies as we change tasks/companies or as time goes
  on.
  
* we're also going to learn quite a bit about NPM: the package manager for JS.
  there's a lot of useful stuff in there, and we'll use a variety of packages
  for our projects.
